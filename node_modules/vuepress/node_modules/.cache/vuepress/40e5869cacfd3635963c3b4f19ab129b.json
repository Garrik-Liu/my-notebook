The goal can be a product, service, or an outstanding result.  A project is temporary and unique.  This means a project has a defined begin and end time, and is not a routine operation.  In addition, a project usually has a budget.</p>\n<h3 id=\"_1-2list-at-least-four-attributes-of-a-project\"><a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"#_1-2list-at-least-four-attributes-of-a-project\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a> 1.2\tList at least four attributes of a project.</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Projects have a start and finish point.</li>\n<li>Projects have a set budget, which is capitalised.</li>\n<li>A project has a number of steps that make up the project life cycle</li>\n<li>Projects should have a primary customer or sponsor.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"_1-3elaborate-on-the-terms-“progressive-elaboration”-and-“iterative-fashion”\"><a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"#_1-3elaborate-on-the-terms-“progressive-elaboration”-and-“iterative-fashion”\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a> 1.3\tElaborate on the terms “progressive elaboration” and “iterative fashion”.</h3>\n<p>progressive elaboration involves continuously improving and detailing a plan as more detailed and specific information and more accurate estimates become available. Progressive elaboration allows a project management team to define work and manage it to a greater level of detail as the project evolves.</p>\n<p>Iterative fashion tends to be smaller, more experienced, and able to work without much supervision, improve the completion rate of each link, and effectively promote project management methods for project construction.</p>\n<h3 id=\"_1-4describe-what-project-management-is-and-why-it-is-important\"><a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"#_1-4describe-what-project-management-is-and-why-it-is-important\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a> 1.4\tDescribe what Project Management is and why it is important.</h3>\n<p>Project management is the practice of initiating, planning, executing, controlling, and closing the work of a team to achieve specific goals and meet specific success criteria at the specified time. Project management, then, is the application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to project activities to meet the project requirements.</p>\n<p>Project management is important because it ensures proper expectations are set around what can be delivered, by when, and for how much.</p>\n<h3 id=\"_1-5list-and-describe-the-four-core-functions-of-project-management-and-elaborate-on-the-three-major-constraints-of-project-management\"><a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"#_1-5list-and-describe-the-four-core-functions-of-project-management-and-elaborate-on-the-three-major-constraints-of-project-management\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a> 1.5\tList and describe the four core functions of project management and elaborate on the three major constraints of project management.</h3>\n<p>Four core functions of project management:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Scope, which defines the boundaries of the project and what is outside those boundaries. The boundaries are typically defined in terms of objectives, deliverables, and resources (e.g., time, personnel, money). The more aspects of scope you can identify, the better off your project will be.</li>\n<li>Time, which involves establishing a timeline for completion of the project, including deadlines, benchmarks, and milestones.</li>\n<li>Cost, which is the amount of money that will be required to complete the project successfully.</li>\n<li>Quality, which refers to the ability of a process or product to satisfy both stated and implied needs, with those needs being defined by the stakeholders.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Three major constraints of project management:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Cost: All projects have a finite budget; the customer is willing to spend a certain amount of money for delivery of a new product or service. If you reduce the project's cost, you will either have to reduce its scope or increase its time.</li>\n<li>Time (Schedule): As the saying goes, 'time is money', a commodity that slips away too easily. Projects have a deadline date for delivery. When you reduce the project's time, you will either have to increase its cost or reduce its scope.</li>\n<li>Scope: Many projects fail on this constraint because the scope of the project is either not fully defined or understood from the start. When you increase a project's scope, you will either have to increase its cost or time.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"_1-6list-and-describe-the-four-facilitating-functions-of-project-management\"><a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"#_1-6list-and-describe-the-four-facilitating-functions-of-project-management\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a> 1.6\tList and describe the four facilitating functions of project management.</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Human resources are the knowledge, skills, values, and attitudes of those working on the project.</li>\n<li>Communication is a two-way process of reaching mutual understanding in which participants not only exchange information, but also create and share meaning.</li>\n<li>A risk is a threat of a damage, liability, loss, or other negative occurrence that is caused by external or internal vulnerabilities.</li>\n<li>Procurement is the way that businesses and organizations purchase or obtain goods or services.
