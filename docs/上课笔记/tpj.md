## Part 1 – An Introduction to Project 

### 1.1	Explain what a project is.

A project is a series of tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve a specific goal.  The goal can be a product, service, or an outstanding result.  A project is temporary and unique.  This means a project has a defined begin and end time, and is not a routine operation.  In addition, a project usually has a budget.

### 1.2	List at least four attributes of a project.

1. Projects have a start and finish point.
2. Projects have a set budget, which is capitalised.
3. A project has a number of steps that make up the project life cycle
4. Projects should have a primary customer or sponsor.

### 1.3	Elaborate on the terms “progressive elaboration” and “iterative fashion”.

progressive elaboration involves continuously improving and detailing a plan as more detailed and specific information and more accurate estimates become available. Progressive elaboration allows a project management team to define work and manage it to a greater level of detail as the project evolves.

Iterative fashion tends to be smaller, more experienced, and able to work without much supervision, improve the completion rate of each link, and effectively promote project management methods for project construction.

### 1.4	Describe what Project Management is and why it is important.

Project management is the practice of initiating, planning, executing, controlling, and closing the work of a team to achieve specific goals and meet specific success criteria at the specified time. Project management, then, is the application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to project activities to meet the project requirements.

Project management is important because it ensures proper expectations are set around what can be delivered, by when, and for how much.

### 1.5	List and describe the four core functions of project management and elaborate on the three major constraints of project management.

Four core functions of project management:

1.	Scope, which defines the boundaries of the project and what is outside those boundaries. The boundaries are typically defined in terms of objectives, deliverables, and resources (e.g., time, personnel, money). The more aspects of scope you can identify, the better off your project will be. 
2.	Time, which involves establishing a timeline for completion of the project, including deadlines, benchmarks, and milestones.
3.	 Cost, which is the amount of money that will be required to complete the project successfully.
4.	Quality, which refers to the ability of a process or product to satisfy both stated and implied needs, with those needs being defined by the stakeholders.

Three major constraints of project management:

1.	Cost: All projects have a finite budget; the customer is willing to spend a certain amount of money for delivery of a new product or service. If you reduce the project's cost, you will either have to reduce its scope or increase its time.
2.	Time (Schedule): As the saying goes, 'time is money', a commodity that slips away too easily. Projects have a deadline date for delivery. When you reduce the project's time, you will either have to increase its cost or reduce its scope.
3.	Scope: Many projects fail on this constraint because the scope of the project is either not fully defined or understood from the start. When you increase a project's scope, you will either have to increase its cost or time.

### 1.6	List and describe the four facilitating functions of project management.

1.	Human resources are the knowledge, skills, values, and attitudes of those working on the project.
2.	 Communication is a two-way process of reaching mutual understanding in which participants not only exchange information, but also create and share meaning.  
3.	A risk is a threat of a damage, liability, loss, or other negative occurrence that is caused by external or internal vulnerabilities.
4.	Procurement is the way that businesses and organizations purchase or obtain goods or services.  Procurement may involve specifications development, price negotiation, purchase orders, purchasing, inventory control, and invoices.

### 1.7	Describe what a stakeholder is, and provide at least four examples.

Stakeholders are the people involved in or affected by project activities, such as the project sponsor, the project manager, the project team, customers, etc. 

### 1.8	Define project success.

1.	Desired outcomes and results listed in the project agreement are achieved. 
2.	The client’s problem is solved. 
3.	The project is finished on time and within budget. 
4.	You and your client sustain a high-quality, working relationship. 

## Part 2 – Strategic Planning Process

### 2.1 Describe the purpose of project planning.
The main purpose of project planning is to guide execution. 

### 2.2 Apply SWOT Analysis (Strength, Weakness, Opportunities, and Threats) to examine your own project.

* Strength:
    * Abundant online documents and tutorials 
    * Experienced with Web App
    * Strong self-learning skills 
    * Good friendship between team members
* Weakness:
    * No experience with Raspberry Pi 3 before
    * No experience with Cloud Server
    * Do not have enough time to focus on TPJ project 
* Opportunities:
    * Learn how to build an Internet of Things project with Raspberry Pi
    * Have a better understanding of project management and properly schedule our time.
    * Have a deeper understanding of group work.
* Threats:
    * All functions are built on Internet.  If Internet is not available, the device and app do not work as well.


## Part 3 – Initiating Projects

### 3.1	List the five project management process groups. 

1.	**Initiating**: During this phase, you can define what the project is about, develop the initial scope and initial cost, estimate resource and budget.  In addition, you also need to identify who the project stakeholders are.
2.	**Planning**: During this phase, you need to figure out how to perform this project.  A workable plan needs to be done.
3.	**Executing**: During this phase, every group member needs to execute the tasks that identified in the plan.  
4.	**Monitoring and Control**: During this phase, you need to check if the project is performing as planned, measure the progress toward achieving project goals, 
5.	**Closing**: During this phase, you need to get the clients to accept the completed project.  A project report should be done also.

### 3.2	Describe the purpose of holding a project kick-off meeting

A project kick-off meeting is usually the first meeting held at the beginning of a project.  In the meeting the project team need to introduce the project to clients and other stakeholders, and discuss the project's goals and plans with them.  

### Describe good practices of team meetings(give four points)

1. Meetings should create value.  During a meeting, people should talk about important ideas, key decisions or any valuable things that must talk face to face.  Some daily discuss should be done with email or chat apps.
2. Plan the meeting in advance will get better result.  Before the meeting, a written agenda best gets in the hands of every participants so that they can prepare for the meeting, and know what topics will be discussed later.
3. Keep the meeting to be short.  People can not pay attentions for a long time.  A brief summary of meeting topics will be helpful for participants.
4. Make sure every participants knows what they are expected to do recently, before the end of the meeting. 

## Part 4 – Planning Projects 

### 4.1 Explain what Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is

A work breakdown structure is used to break up the team's work into manageable tasks, so that you can plan, perform, track, and manage your project effectively.

### 4.2 Explain what a WBS dictionary is

WBS dictionary is a reference document which provides the definition for each WBS component.  It includes entries for each WBS component that briefly defines the scope or statement of the work, defines deliverables, contains a list of associated activities, and provides a list of recognized milestones to gage progress.

### 4.3 Explain the purpose of creating a Gantt chart

A Gantt chart is a graphical schedule that used to plan, coordinate and track project tasks.  Each tasks' begin time, finish time and depandencies are shown on the chart.  By using gantt chart, you can get a clear illustration of project status.  

### 4.4 List four types of project task dependencies

1. Start-to-Finish
2. Start-to-Start
3. Finish-to-Finish
4. Finish-to-Start

### 4.5 Describe Activity Resource Estimating: Duration vs. Effort, Discrete, Range and three - Point Estimates

* Duration 

### 4.6 Explain what Critical Path Analysis is and its importance. 

Critical Path Analysis is a technique that used to allow a project to be completed in the shortest possible time.  The critical path is the sequence of activities with the longest duration.  Through analysing the critical path, it can help you to calculate minimum amount of time the project will take to complete, and identify what activities must be completed on time in order to keep the project to complete on time.

### 4.7 Describe what a project buffer is.

A project buffer is extra time added before the project deadline in order to prevent the project delay or unexpected mistakes.
