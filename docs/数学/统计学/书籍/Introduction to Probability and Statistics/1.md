# Introduction to Probability and Statistics

## Introduction: Train Your Brain for Statistics

- In the language of statistics, a specified number of measurements or data is a ==**sample (样本)**==;
- Sample is drawn from a much larger body of measurements, called the ==**population (总体)**==.
  - 🌰 **E.g.** For the body-temperature experiment, the ++sample++ is the set of body-temperature measurements for the 148 healthy people chosen by the experimenter. We hope that the sample is representative of a much larger body of measurements, the ++population++, the body temperatures of all healthy people in the world!
- We try to describe or predict the behaviour of the population on the basis of information obtained from a representative sample from that population;

- ==**Descriptive statistics (描述统计)**== consists of procedures used to summarize and describe the important characteristics of a set of measurements.
  - 🌰 bar charts, pie charts, and line charts
  - If the set of measurements is the entire population, you need only to draw conclusions based on the descriptive statistics;
  - However, it might be too expensive or too time-consuming to enumerate the entire population;
  - By looking at the sample, you want to answer questions about the population as a whole. The branch of statistics that deals with this problem is called inferential statistics;
- ==**Inferential statistics (推论统计)**== consists of procedures used to make inferences about population characteristics from information contained in a sample drawn from this population;
  - The objective of inferential statistics is to make inferences (that is, draw conclusions, make predictions, make decisions) about the characteristics of a population from information contained in a sample.

---

**Follow a series of logical steps**, you can make inferences about a population using information contained in a sample:

1. Specify the questions to be answered and identify the population of interest.
2. Decide how to select the sample.
3. Select the sample and analyze the sample information.
4. Use the information from step 3 to make an inference about the population.
5. Determine the reliability of the inference.

## 1. Describing Data with Graphs

#### Variables and Data

- A ==**variable**== is a characteristic that changes or varies over time and/or for different individuals or objects under consideration.
  - 🌰 body temperature is a variable that changes over time within a single individual; it also varies from person to person
- An ==**experimental unit (实验单位)**== is the individual or object on which a variable is measured.
- A single ==**measurement (测量)**== or data value results when a variable is actually measured on an experimental unit.
- A ==**population**== is the set of all measurements of interest to the investigator.
- A ==**sample**== is a subset of measurements selected from the population of interest.

#### Types of Variables

Variables can be classified into one of two categories:

- ==**Qualitative variables (定性变量, 类别变量)**== measure a quality or characteristic on each experimental unit.
  - Qualitative variables produce data that can be categorized according to similarities or differences in kind; hence, they are often called ==**categorical data (类别数据)**==
  - 🌰 gender, year, and major
- ==**Quantitative variables (定量变量)**== measure a numerical quantity or amount on each experimental unit.
  - there is a difference in the types of numerical values that these quantitative variables can assume:
    - A ==**discrete variable (离散变量)**== can assume only a finite or countable number of values.
      - 🌰 family members, number of new car sales
    - A ==**continuous variable (连续变量)**== can assume the infinitely many values corresponding to the points on a line interval
      - height, weight, time, distance

#### Graphs for Categorical Data

After the data have been collected, they can be consolidated and summarized to show the following information:

- What values of the variable have been measured
- How often each value has occurred

For this purpose, you can construct a statistical table that can be used to display the data graphically as a data distribution.

When the variable of interest is **qualitative**, the statistical table is a list of the categories being considered along with a measure of **how often each value occurred**. You can measure “how often” in three different ways:

- The ==**frequency**==, or number of measurements in each category
- The ==**relative frequency**==, or proportion of measurements in each category
- The ==**percentage**== of measurements in each category For example, if you let

Once the measurements have been categorized and summarized in a statistical table, you can use either a pie chart or a bar chart to display the distribution of the data:

- The ==**pie chart**== is used to display the relationship of the parts to the whole;
- The ==**bar chart**== is used to emphasize the actual quantity or frequency for each category.

#### Graphs for Quantitative Data

For quantitative variable, you can use pie charts or bar charts to describe the data, using the amount measured in each category rather than the frequency of occurrence of each category:

- The ==**pie chart**== displays how the total quantity is distributed among the categories;
- The ==**bar chart**== uses the height of the bar to display the amount in a particular category.

When a quantitative variable is recorded over time at equally spaced intervals (such as daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, or yearly), the data set forms a **time series**.

Time series data are most effectively presented on a ==**line chart**== with time as the horizontal axis.

Many sets of quantitative data consist of numbers that cannot easily be separated into categories or intervals of time.

The simplest graph for quantitative data is the ==**dotplot**==

==**Stem and leaf plot**== presents a graphical display of the data using the actual numerical values of each data point.

#### Interpreting Graphs with a Critical Eye

- A distribution is ==**symmetric (对称分布)**== if the left and right sides of the distribution, when divided at the middle value, form mirror images.
- A distribution is ==**skewed to the right (右偏态分布)**== if a greater proportion of the measurements lie to the right of the peak value. Distributions that are skewed right contain a few unusually large measurements.
- A distribution is ==**skewed to the left (左偏态分布)**== if a greater proportion of the measurements lie to the left of the peak value. Distributions that are skewed left contain a few unusually small measurements.

- A distribution is ==**unimodal (单峰分布)**== if it has one peak; a ==**bimodal (双峰分布)**== distribution has two peaks. Bimodal distributions often represent a mixture of two different populations in the data set.

#### Relative Frequency Histograms

A relative frequency ==**histogram (直方图)**== for a quantitative data set is a bar graph in which the height of the bar shows “**how often**” (measured as a proportion or relative frequency) measurements fall in a particular class or subinterval. The classes or subintervals are plotted along the horizontal axis.

How to Construct a Relative Frequency Histogram

1.  Choose the number of classes, usually between 5 and 12. The more data you have, the more classes you should use.
2.  Calculate the approximate class width by dividing the difference between the largest and smallest values by the number of classes.
3.  Round the approximate class width up to a convenient number.
4.  If the data are discrete, you might assign one class for each integer value taken on by the data. For a large number of integer values, you may need to group them into classes.
5.  Locate the class boundaries. The lowest class must include the smallest measurement. Then add the remaining classes using the left inclusion method.
6.  Construct a statistical table containing the classes, their frequencies, and their relative frequencies.
7.  Construct the histogram like a bar graph, plotting class intervals on the horizontal axis and relative frequencies as the heights of the bars.
