- The compiler translates each HLL statement into one or more assembly language instructions
- The assembler translate each assembly language instruction into one machine language instruction
- Each processor instruction can be written either in machine language form or assembly language form
- üå∞ E.g, for the Intel Pentium:
  - Assembly language: `MOV AL, 5`
  - Machine language: `10110000 00000101`

#### Assembly Language Today

- A program written directly in assembly language has the potential to have a smaller executable and to **run faster** than a HLL program
- Assembly language are often used in embedded system programs stored in PROM chips
- you will learn assembly language to learn **how high-level language code gets translated into machine language**

## Memory Units for the Intel x86

- The **smallest** addressable unit is the **BYTE**
- 1 byte = 8 bits
- 1 word = 2 bytes
- 1 double word = 2 words (= 32 bits)
- 1 quad word = 2 double words (= 64 bits)

## Number Systems

- A written number is meaningful only with respect to a **base**
- To tell the assembler which base we use:
  - **Hexadecimal** 25 is written as 25h
  - **Octal** 25 is written as 25o or 25q
  - **Binary** 1010 is written as 1010b
  - **Decimal** 1010 is written as 1010 or 1010d

### Binary Numbers

- Digits are 1 and 0
  - 1 = true
  - 0 = false
- **MSB** ‚Äì most significant bit
- **LSB** ‚Äì least significant bit

### Translating Unsigned Decimal to Binary

- Repeatedly divide the decimal integer by 2;
- Each remainder is a binary digit in the translated value;

### Binary Subtraction

- When subtracting A ‚Äì B, convert B to its two's complement
- Add A to (‚ÄìB)

### Ranges of Signed Integers

### Maximum and Minimum Values

- for a signed byte
  - smallest positive = 0000 0000b
  - largest positive = 0111 1111b = 127
  - largest negative = -1 = 1111 1111b
  - smallest negative = 1000 0000b = -128

## Character Representation

- Each character is represented by a 7-bit code called the **ASCII code**
- ASCII codes run from **00h to 7Fh**
- Only codes from **20h to 7Eh** represent **printable characters**. The rest are control codes (used for printing, transmission‚Ä¶).

- CR = ‚Äúcarriage return‚Äù (Windows: move to beginning of line)
- LF = ‚Äúline feed‚Äù (Windows: move directly one line below)
- SPC = ‚Äúblank space‚Äù

## Text Files

- These are files containing only **printable** ASCII characters (for the **text**)
- And **non-printable** ASCII characters to mark each **end of line**.
- Different conventions are used for indicating an ‚Äúend of line‚Äù
  - Windows: `<CR>+<LF>`
  - UNIX: `<LF>`
  - MAC: `<CR>`
- This is at the origin of many problems encountered during transfers of text files from one system to another

## Character sets

- Standard ASCII (0 ‚Äì 127)
- Extended ASCII (0 ‚Äì 255)
- ANSI (0 ‚Äì 255)
- Unicode (0 ‚Äì 65,535)
