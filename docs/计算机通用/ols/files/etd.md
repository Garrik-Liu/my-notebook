## Project Management

### Part 1

#### What defines a project?

temporary endeavor with a beginning and an end and it must be used to create a unique product, service or result

#### How is a project different than operations?

Projects are defined as unique, temporary endeavors with a specific beginning and end.

Operations constitute an organization's on-going, repetitive activities, such as accounting or production. 

#### What are the five processes of project management? What is involved with each of these?

1. **initiation**: determine whether or not it benefits the organization
2. **planning**: outlining the work to be performed, a team should prioritize the project, calculate a budget and schedule, and determine what resources are needed. 
3. **execution**: Resources' tasks are distributed and teams are informed of responsibilities
4. **performance & control**: Project managers will compare project status and progress to the actual plan, may need to adjust schedules or do what is necessary to keep the project on track. 
5. **close**: After project tasks are completed and the client has approved the outcome, an evaluation is necessary to highlight project success and/or learn from project history. 

#### Compare Traditional vs. Iterative project management approaches.

**Traditional** (or waterfall) project management follows a fixed sequence, When one process is complete, only then can the next one begin.

**Iterative** is more flexiable, it focus into evolving changes and collaborative effort to bring out results rather than a predefined process.

#### What is project management important?

Project management is important because it:
* ensures what is being delivered, 
* brings leadership and direction to projects
* ensures there’s a proper plan 
* ensures proper expectations 
* ensures the quality of whatever is being delivered
* ensures risks are properly managed
* ensures a project’s progress is tracked

#### What are the crucial characteristics of an effective project manager?

1. **They Inspire a Shared Vision**: having a vision of where to go and the ability to articulate it
2. **They are a Good Communicator**: ability to communicate with people at all levels
3. **Integrity**: represents set of values, dedication to honesty, and consistency in behaviors with team mates
4. **They are Well Organized**:  creating a productive work environment as well as solving problems under pressure
5. **They are Great Problem Solver**: mastery of handling issues in most effective ways.

#### What factors influence project management in a given organization?

1. Deadline:
2. Budget:
3. Stakeholders:
4. Project Members:
5. Price:
6. Supply:
7. Demand:

#### What is project management software used for? What is a Gantt Chart?

Project management software is software used for project planning, scheduling, resource allocation and change management.

It allows project managers (PMs), stakeholders and users to control costs and manage budgeting, quality management and documentation and also may be used as an administration system.

**A Gantt chart**, commonly used in project management, is one of the most popular and useful ways of showing activities (tasks or events) displayed against time.

On the left of the chart is a list of the activities and along the top is a suitable time scale. 

Each activity is represented by a bar; the position and length of the bar reflects the start date, duration and end date of the activity. 

#### What is a strategic objective?

Strategic Objective (Strategic Goal) is a term denoting the highest goals of the organization or an individual.

Objectives are the specific measurable results of the initiative.  An organization's objectives offer specifics of how much of what will be accomplished by when.

#### What are your strategic objective in completing your education at Seneca?

#### How do you plan to meet these objectives?

### Part 2

#### Which process group do the elements detailed in this segment address?

#### What is the key purpose of Project Initiation and what does it involve?

The purpose of initiating a project is to obtain commitment to start the project. 

Typically, the first step in project initiation is to assign the project manager.  

During project initiation, you identify the problem the project is supposed to solve and you gather information to define the project. 


#### What is a Project Charter?

Project Charter provides a statement of roles and responsibilities, outlines the project objectives, identifies the main stakeholders, and defines the authority of the project manager. 

#### What is a Project Stakeholder? Why are they important and how must a project manage them?

Project stakeholders are entities that have an interest in a given project

#### What is the project problem statement? What isn’t it?

A problem statement is a clear concise description of the issue(s) that need(s) to be addressed by a problem solving team.

A simple and well-defined problem statement will be used by the project team to understand the problem 

#### What are project goals and objectives? How are they different?

Goals and objectives are statements that describe what the project will accomplish,

**Goals** are high level statements that provide overall context for what the project is trying to achieve

**Objectives** are lower level statements that describe the specific, tangible products and deliverables that the project will deliver.

#### What are key characteristics of project objectives?

Good project objectives should be "SMART", It stands for "Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic and Time-Bound."

* **S pecific**: clear about what, where, when, and how the situation will be changed;
* **M easurable**: able to quantify the targets and benefits; 
* **A chievable**: able to attain the objectives 
* **R ealistic**: able to obtain the level of change reflected in the objective
* **T ime-Bound**: stating the time period in which they will each be accomplished.

#### What is meant by scope and approach?

Project Scope describes the boundaries of a project, it ensure that your project includes all the work required to complete the project, no more, no less.

#### What are deliverables and success criteria? Why are they important?

project deliverables are the results that the project delivers. To determine whether deliverables are what you wanted, you need some way to measure them. Those measurements are called success criteria.

deliverables then help you measure progress.

#### Why is it important to evaluate assumptions and risks early in a project? 

An **assumption** is something that someone will do some tasks without confirming it. 

不说但是要做的事

Assumptions can be tricky because people often don't realize they're assuming something. 

The key is to get assumptions out in the open that way you can make sure everyone is on the same page

A **risk** is a situation or event that might occur that could affect your project positively or negatively.   

Early on in a project spend some time identifying risks that could affect the project. 

### Part 3

#### What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)?

 A work breakdown structure, or WBS, is what you use to divvy up project work into bite sized pieces

So you can plan, track, and manage your project effectively

 Creating a WBS helps the project in several ways. 
 * First, it's easier to estimate time and cost for smaller chunks of work. 
 * Second, it's easier to assign work to team members. 
 * Third, by breaking work into smaller pieces, you build check points into your project that allow you to measure progress. 

#### What is the best way to build a WBS?

The best way to build a WBS is to start split summuary tasks into smaller tasks and 

#### What is a Work Package and what determines the  amount of detail needed in it?

 To give your team the info they need, create work package documents that describe, in detail, the work identified in the WBS. 

The level of detail you include in the work package document depends on things like how familiar the work is and the experience of the person assigned to the task.

 For example, a work package document might include a detailed description of the work for a less experienced person. 

#### What is a Communication Plan and why is it important?

The right people, getting the right information, at the right time, and in the right way. To do that, you need to plan project communication. 

A communication plan helps to ensure that people get the information they need in the most effective way. 

#### What is a Change Management Plan and why is it important?

A Change Management Plan helps you incorporate important changes into your project,

The change management plan will minimize the impact a change can have on the business, employees, customers, and other important stakeholders.

A Change Management Plan helps you include changes that make sense in your project, while protecting your project from being overwhelmed with unnecessary changes. 

#### What are dependencies in project sequencing? What are the four types and which is the most common?

A task dependency is when one task controls the timing of another.

For example, you have to place equipment in rooms before you can connect them to the network. 

* **Finish-to-Start**: The finish of one task controls when the other task starts.
* **Start-to-Start**: the start of one task triggers the start of the other.
* **Finish-to-Finish**: the finish of one task controls the finish of the other. 
* **Start-to-Finish**: The start of one task triggers the finish of another.

#### What are Milestones?

They show when you've accomplished key tasks or portions of a project, and they make it easy to see how much you've completed and when it finished. 

#### What is meant by Critical Path?

The critical path is the sequence of tasks in your schedule with the longest duration.

#### Why is a critical path important to a project’s success

 Why is the critical path so critical? Because any delay on that path delays the finish date of the project. 

 you can shorten the project schedule if you can figure out how to shorten the critical path

### Part 4 

#### What are some of the major challengesinvolved with communications?

#### What is meant by microskills?

basic communication skills, such as paraphrasing, reflecting feelings, summarizing, asking open and closed questions, providing factual information, using minimal prompts, and using body language and facial expressions to demonstrate listening 

#### What s meant by “Space, Face and Place”?

#### What is meant by the terms self-awareness, self-regulation, self-motivation, empathy, social attention and focus?

Self Awareness is having a clear perception of your personality, including strengths, weaknesses, thoughts, beliefs, motivation, and emotions. 

#### What is emotional intelligence? Why is it important in team work? Provide practical examples

the capacity to be aware of, control, and express one's emotions, and to handle interpersonal relationships judiciously and empathetically.

#### Closed and Opened Question

Closed-ended questions are those which can be answered by a simple "yes" or "no," while open-ended questions are those which require more thought and more than a simple one-word answer.

## Python

#### Difference between functions and methods in Python?

A function is a piece of code that is called by name. It can be passed data to operate on (i.e., the parameters) and can optionally return data (the return value). All data that is passed to a function is explicitly passed.


* 函数代码块以 def 关键词开头，后接函数标识符名称和圆括号()。
* 任何传入参数和自变量必须放在圆括号中间。圆括号之间可以用于定义参数。
* 函数的第一行语句可以选择性地使用文档字符串—用于存放函数说明。
* 函数内容以冒号起始，并且缩进。
* return [表达式] 结束函数，选择性地返回一个值给调用方。不带表达式的return相当于返回 None。

``` python

def printme( str ):
   "打印传入的字符串到标准显示设备上"
   print str
   return
```

A method is a piece of code that is called by name that is associated with an object. 

``` python
class Dog:
    def my_method(self):
        print "I am a Dog"

dog = Dog()
dog.my_method()  # Prints "I am a Dog"
```

#### List & Tuple & 字典

列表可以完成大多数集合类的数据结构实现。它支持字符，数字，字符串甚至可以包含列表（即嵌套）

``` python
list = [ 'runoob', 786 , 2.23, 'john', 70.2 ]
tinylist = [123, 'john']
 
print list               # 输出完整列表
print list[0]            # 输出列表的第一个元素
print list[1:3]          # 输出第二个至第三个元素 
print list[2:]           # 输出从第三个开始至列表末尾的所有元素
print tinylist * 2       # 输出列表两次
print list + tinylist    # 打印组合的列表
```

Tuple 类似于 List（列表）。元组用"()"标识。内部元素用逗号隔开。但是元组不能二次赋值，相当于只读列表。

``` python
tuple = ( 'runoob', 786 , 2.23, 'john', 70.2 )
tinytuple = (123, 'john')
 
print tuple               # 输出完整元组
print tuple[0]            # 输出元组的第一个元素
print tuple[1:3]          # 输出第二个至第三个的元素 
print tuple[2:]           # 输出从第三个开始至列表末尾的所有元素
print tinytuple * 2       # 输出元组两次
print tuple + tinytuple   # 打印组合的元组
```

列表是有序的对象集合，字典是无序的对象集合。 两者之间的区别在于：字典当中的元素是通过键来存取的，而不是通过偏移存取。 

``` python
dict = {}
dict['one'] = "This is one"
dict[2] = "This is two"
 
tinydict = {'name': 'john','code':6734, 'dept': 'sales'}
 
 
print dict['one']          # 输出键为'one' 的值
print dict[2]              # 输出键为 2 的值
print tinydict             # 输出完整的字典
print tinydict.keys()      # 输出所有键
print tinydict.values()    # 输出所有值
```

#### help

``` python
help(xxxx)
```

#### dir()

Without arguments, return the list of names in the current local scope. With an argument, attempt to return a list of valid attributes for that object.

``` python
>>> import struct

>>> dir()   
# show the names in the module namespace
['__builtins__', '__doc__', '__name__', 'struct']

>>> dir(struct)   
# show the names in the struct module
['Struct', '__builtins__', '__doc__', '__file__', '__name__',
 '__package__', '_clearcache', 'calcsize', 'error', 'pack', 'pack_into',
 'unpack', 'unpack_from']

>>> class Shape(object):
        def __dir__(self):
            return ['area', 'perimeter', 'location']
>>> s = Shape()

>>> dir(s)
['area', 'perimeter', 'location']
```

#### Classes and Objects

``` python
class Employee:
   '所有员工的基类'
   empCount = 0
 
   def __init__(self, name, salary):
      self.name = name
      self.salary = salary
      Employee.empCount += 1
   
   def displayCount(self):
     print "Total Employee %d" % Employee.empCount
 
   def displayEmployee(self):
      print "Name : ", self.name,  ", Salary: ", self.salary

"创建 Employee 类的第一个对象"
emp1 = Employee("Zara", 2000)
"创建 Employee 类的第二个对象"
emp2 = Employee("Manni", 5000)
```
* `empCount` 变量是一个类变量，它的值将在这个类的所有实例之间共享。你可以在内部类或外部类使用 `Employee.empCount` 访问。
* `__init__()`方法是一种特殊的方法，被称为类的构造函数或初始化方法，当创建了这个类的实例时就会调用该方法
* `self` 代表类的实例，`self` 在定义类的方法时是必须有的，虽然在调用时不必传入相应的参数。
