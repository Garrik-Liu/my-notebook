# 数据库设计理论

数据库设计过程中需要遵循一些原则:

- **数据依赖理论**
- **关系范式理论**
- **模式分解理论**

## 函数依赖

### 什么是函数依赖

### 完全函数依赖 & 传递函数依赖

### 函数依赖的公理和定理

### 函数依赖集的最小覆盖

## 关系范式

## 模式分解

1. A **context switch** is a way of storing the state of a process or thread temporarily. And, it can be recovered when this process or thread is needed at a later point.

2. Difference between a zombie process and an orphan process:

   - **Zombie**: Parent process has not yet invoked wait() but child process has terminated;
   - **Orphan**: Parent process has terminated without invoking wait(), child process is alive;

3. "in" and "out" are offsets of buffer. If the number of element is BUFFER_SIZE, "in = out" when the buffer is empty or full. We need a way to distinguish the "empty" and "full";

4. Belly Rub
